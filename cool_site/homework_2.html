      <h1>Sarcastic Memes</h1>

      <h2><a href="http://www.someecards.com">Some Ecards</a></h2>
      <p>I found this site while just looking up funny memes online. I thought it was funny because they had a meme for every
      situation, such as birthdays, halloween,love, sex etc. The only thing that I wasnt so happy about was how busy the site is.
      It makes your eyes work alot when finding the link you want to click on.</p>
