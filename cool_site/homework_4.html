      <p>This site reminded me of the old version of Microsoft Paint. It brought back alot of memories from my childhood.
      Now that I use Photoshop and Illustator for my major, it makes sense that I used to be on paint all day. This site
      is very easy to use, and has all the basic drawing features.  </p>
