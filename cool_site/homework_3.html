      <h2><a href="http://www.stephen.com/mondrimat/mondrian/kh.html">Colors</a></h2>
      <p>While looking through a few museum sites I found this as a randomlink on a search page. I thought it was
      pretty cool because it resembled the work of Mondrian, one of the great artist of the 40's. The site works just by
    clicking on different parts of the page. you can split it verticaly and horizontaly, depending on where you clicked it.</p>
